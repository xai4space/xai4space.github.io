# Project

In **PINEAPPLE**, we aim to address the lack of "trust" in (deep) machine learning algorithms for earth observation. We tackle two real-life earth observation downstream tasks: **(1)** estimating soil parameters from hyperspectral imaging (HSI), and **(2)** detecting methane in HSI, using new deep and classic machine learning algorithms empowered by explainable AI (XAI) methods. 

We believe that **PINEAPPLE** will be an important step toward not only "uncovering the magic" behind learning algorithms (hence building trust in them in earth observation downstream tasks), but also in showing that XAI methods can be effectively used to improve such data-driven algorithms, ultimately leading to better predictive models.

We put special effort into:
1. unbiasing the validation of existing and emerging algorithms through ensuring their full reproducibility, both at the algorithm and at the data level, and
2. understanding & improving the generalization of such algorithms when fundamentally different data is used for testing, e.g. noisy, with simulated other atmospheric conditions, captured in different area/time.

Research project done in collaboration between **KP Labs** and **MI2.AI (Warsaw University of Technology)**; funded by the **European Space Agency** grant no. ESA AO/1-11524/22/I-DT.

> Remote sensing applications require machine learning models that are reliable and robust, highlighting the importance of red teaming for uncovering flaws and biases. We introduce a novel red teaming approach for hyperspectral image analysis, specifically for soil parameter estimation in the Hyperview challenge. Utilizing SHAP for red teaming, we enhanced the top-performing model based on our findings. Additionally, we introduced a new visualization technique to improve model understanding in the hyperspectral domain.
